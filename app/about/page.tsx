                        Hi, Iâ€™m Hadil, a graphic designer who loves to create captivating designs that tell stories and evoke emotions.
                    </p>
                    <p className="">
                        Iâ€™m based in Tyre, Lebanon, but I work with clients from all over the world.
                        <br />I have been working as a professional designer for over two years. I have experience in branding, advertising, social media, animation, publication, and web design. I use Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, XD, and After Effects to bring my ideas to life.
                    </p>
                    <p className="">
                        Some of the projects Iâ€™m most proud of are:
                        <br />A series of <span className="font-semibold">advertising campaigns</span> for DesignFactory, a company that offers innovative design services and products.
                        <br />A web and app <span className="font-semibold">design for a social media</span> platform that connects people who share the same hobbies and interests.
                        <br />You can check out some of my work samples on my portfolio page. Iâ€™m always open to new challenges and opportunities, so feel free to contact me if you have a project in mind or just want to say hi. You can reach me by email, or through my social media accounts.
                    </p>
